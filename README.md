# Tutorial for scRNA-seq data analysis beginners in Python
Currently, this tutorial includes the following parts:
1. The basic and routine analysis on one scRNA-seq data set using `Scanpy` in Python;
2. The basic pseudotime, trajectory and fate probability analysis
3. Data integration or batch effect correction for joint analysis of multiple scRNA-seq data sets;

What will be coming next:
1. Brief introduction of more advanced analysis, including RNA velocity analysis and cell-cell communication analysis;
2. Deep-learning-based data integration and projection.

The example data used in this tutorial are mostly from the paper [Organoid single-cell genomic atlas uncovers human-specific features of brain development](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1654-9). 

Please contact Dr. Zhisong He (zhisong.he(at)bsse.ethz.ch) if there is any question.
